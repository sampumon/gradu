SAMPUMON SUPERHUB THESIS

The SUPERHUB project¹ has created a multimodal journey planning scheme which encourages users towards sustainability and sociability. I have created an HTML5 visualization for the journey planning, which shows all possible transport types on the same map+list visualization, allowing users to compare between different criteria in one view.

The visualization shows, for example, the following journey plans per journey search:

- walk/bike
- walk + shared bike (with bike stations)
- walk + public transport
- bike + public transport (accounting for transport bike acceptance)
- car/taxi
- car + public transport (with parking)
- skiing (on winter! using ski track data)
- skiing + public transport (yes for real)

Each journey plan is simultaneously shown on a list and on a map, presenting all required criteria and decision data in one view.

ADDENDUM-LIKE SECTION.  Possible transport types include public transportation (bus, tram, metro, train, ferry), car, taxi, walk, bike and skiing. For car, taxi and bike, sharing schemes are included.  Different criteria for journey plans include duration, price, emissions, physical effort, total distance, disruptive events (accidents etc.) and goals (towards sustainability) set by the user.

I argue that the visualization created is superior compared to current journey planners²³⁴⁵, since none of them offer all possible transport types on same view. In fact, they usually only offer one trasport type per view. In this thesis, I introduce the SUPERHUB project and current journey planners which work in Helsinki. I then present the visualization I have created, results of its usability study, and future improvements for journey planning.
