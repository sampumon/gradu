SAMPUMON SUPERHUB THESIS

The SUPERHUB project¹ has created a journey planning scheme which encourages users towards sustainability and sociability. I have created a HTML5 visualization for the journey planning, which shows all possible transport types on same list and map, allowing the user to compare between different criterias.

Possible transport types include public transportation (bus, tram, metro, train, ferry), car, taxi, walking, biking and skiing. For car, taxi and biking, also sharing schemes are included.

Different criterias for journey results include duration, price, emissions, physical effort (walk/bike distance), total distance, disruptive events (accidents etc.) and goals set by the user.

I argue that the visualization I have created is superior compared to current journey planners²³⁴⁵ (in Helsinki), since none of them offer all possible transport types (not even public transport and biking) on same visualization. On this thesis, I introduce the SUPERHUB project and current journey planners, and then present the visualization I created and results of its usability study.
